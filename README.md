newspapercms
============

A lightweight Content Management System for managing digitized newspaper archives.

I am digitizing (some day) 128 years of newspapers for a small town, from microfilm. 
They will be OCRed, made searchable and browsable and be freely available. This 
CMS is being designed with this specific project in mind but hopefully it will 
be useful to you as well.

Some similar commercial projects include CONTENTdm, and ActivePaper? (from Olive Software).
